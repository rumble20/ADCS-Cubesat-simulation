# CubeSat ADCS: Estimation and Control

This repository contains a demonstrator project for an **Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)** applied to a CubeSat. The goal is to provide a learning and portfolio project that showcases skills in **dynamics modeling, control, and sensor fusion**, relevant for aerospace and defense applications.

---

## Features
- CubeSat rotational dynamics simulation (Euler’s equations)
- PD controller for attitude stabilization
- Simulated sensors: gyroscope, magnetometer, sun sensor
- Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for sensor fusion and state estimation
- Visualization of results: angles, angular velocities, estimation errors

---

## Usage

### 1. Dynamics and Control Simulation
```bash
python adcs_simulation.py
```
Outputs:

- Attitude dynamics with external disturbances
- Stabilization using PD control
- Plots of true angles vs controlled response

### 2. Attitude Estimation with EKF
```bash
python ekf_estimation.py
```
Outputs:

- Simulated noisy sensor measurements
- EKF estimates of angle and angular velocity
- Comparison plots (true vs estimated states)

## Example Results

### PD Control
- CubeSat stabilizes to target attitude despite disturbances
- Response plotted as angle vs time

### EKF Estimation
- EKF successfully tracks true angle and angular velocity
- Estimation error decreases over time despite sensor noise

---

## Roadmap
- Add advanced controllers (LQR, Sliding Mode)
- Include realistic perturbations (gravity gradient, aero, solar pressure)
- Full CubeSat mission simulation

---

## Goals
With this personal project I try to demonstrate practical skills in **nonlinear dynamics modeling**, **real-time control laws**, **sensor fusion with Kalman filtering**, **documentation and reproducibility of simulations**.


It serves as a portfolio project for applications in **aerospace and defense industries**.
